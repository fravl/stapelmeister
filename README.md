# Stapelmeister 

A retro-styled tower stacking game built with [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/) and Flutter.  
Inspired by the game **Stack** from Ketchapp.

## How to Play
- A moving block slides back and forth at the top of the screen.  
- **Tap** anywhere to drop it onto the tower.  
- Align blocks as perfectly as possible — any part that sticks out will be cut off!  
- Subsequent blocks get smaller as your accuracy slips.
- If the remaining block gets too small, it’s **game over**.  
- Try to beat your **high score** for each level!
